# monitoring-api
API clients to showcase the RESTful API of the monitoring framework


## Clients
- [C](/clients/c)  --  identical to EXCESS API client; no changes; no support for deployments and summary report
- [Python](/clients/python)  --  includes demo to access deployments; produces summary report

## RheonMedia Use Case
We provide a brief demo for accessing the monitoring database to register workflows, create new experiments, add deployment plans, and to send metric data to the database. The demonstration is realized via the [Python client](/clients/python). More [documentation](/clients/python/doc) on available API functions is documented in the respective subdirectories.
